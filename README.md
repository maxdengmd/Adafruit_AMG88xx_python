# DEPRECATED LIBRARY Adafruit_AMG88xx_python

This is a fork of the library Adafruit_AMG88xx_python from Adafruit. The original library can be found [here](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_AMG88xx_python/)

This library has been deprecated!

We are currently only supporting the circuitpython version of this library - it works great on Raspi/Linux and easier for us to maintain.

we are leaving the code up for historical/research purposes but archiving the repository.

check out this guide for using the amg8833 with python!
